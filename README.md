# Towers of Hanoi
This code implements a solution to the Towers of Hanoi puzzle using Prolog. The Towers of Hanoi is a classic problem that involves moving a stack of disks of different sizes from one peg to another, following certain rules:

* Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the pegs and placing it on top of another peg or on an empty peg.
* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Overall, this code provides a simple implementation of the Towers of Hanoi problem in Prolog. However, it only allows moves to be made one at a time and does not provide a way to automate the solution.

## Built with:
* Prolog
* SWI-Prolog
